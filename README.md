Models for the  [Plotting game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotting_(video_game))
This repository contains PDDL and Essence Prime models for it.

- `generator` : The instance generator
- `instances` : The dataset used in the paper
- `models`    : The normal Essence Prime and PDDL models. Note that as the PDDL with derived predicates needs one domain file per problem, both are located in the `instances` directory.
